      <p>
        1. You need to guess a number between 1 and 100.
        <br />
        2. If your guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, it will be
        considered "OUT OF BOUNDS."
        <br />
        3. On your first turn:
        <br />
        a. If your guess is within 10 of the number, you'll be told "WARM!"
        <br />
        b. If your guess is further than 10 away from the number, you'll be told
        "COLD!"
        <br />
        4. On subsequent turns:
        <br />
        a. If your guess is closer to the number than your previous guess,
        you'll be told "WARMER!"
        <br />
        b. If your guess is farther from the number than your previous guess,
        you'll be told "COLDER!"
        <br />
        5. If your guess equals the number, you'll be informed that you've
        guessed correctly and how many guesses it took!
        <br />
        6. You have 20 guesses.
        <br />
        7. HighScore will be displayed.
